# Orbital Date Picker 🌍🛸

A joke demo app featuring the world's most unnecessarily complex date picker component. Instead of boring old calendars, dates orbit around Earth like celestial bodies in space. Because why make date selection simple when you can make it astronomical?

## 🚀 What is this?

This is a satirical take on overly complex UI components. The Orbital Date Picker represents dates as orbiting elements around a central point (Earth), forcing users to click on moving targets to select a date. It's essentially a date picker designed by someone who thinks traditional calendars are "too easy."
